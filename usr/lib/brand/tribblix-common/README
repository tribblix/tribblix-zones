The files here are shared amongst the various Tribblix zone brands

common.ksh - functions called to the brand scripts

lib.blacklist - a list of files under /lib that should not exist in
  zones; specifically manifests for services that should not run in
  non-global zones. This is separate from the other blacklist due to
  the way that /zonelib is populated for sparse-root zones

std.blacklist - a list of files not under /lib that should not exist in
  zones.
