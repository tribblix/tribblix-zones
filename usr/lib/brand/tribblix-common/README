The files here are shared amongst the various Tribblix zone brands

common.ksh - functions called to the brand scripts

lib.ignorelist - a list of files under /lib that should not exist in
  zones; specifically manifests for services that should not run in
  non-global zones. This is separate from the other ignorelists due to
  the way that /zonelib is populated for sparse-root zones

sparse.ignorelist - a list of files not under /lib that should not exist in
  zones. This list has the files that are copied into all zones, whole or
  sparse, which is essentially /etc

whole.ignorelist - a list of files not under /lib that should not exist in
  zones. This list has those files that would be mounted read-only in a
  sparse zone, which is essentially /usr

pkg.ignorelist - a list of packages whose metadata should never be copied
  to a zone
