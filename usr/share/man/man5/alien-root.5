.SH "NAME"
alien-root zone variant
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The alien-root zone brand in Tribblix allows you to run an
alternative illumos distribution in a zone.
.LP
The current implementation simply populates the zone file systems from
a tarball or an installation ISO image. Tarballs generated by the
zmvix.sh script from the mvi project (https://github.com/ptribble/mvi)
should be suitable. Installation ISO images from OmniOS, OpenIndiana,
XStreamOS, and DilOS should be recognised. Any further customization
or software installation must be done inside the zone.
.LP
The approach used is fragile due to the nature of stable interfaces in
illumos. Namely, the userland in the zone must be similar to that in
the global zone. In illumos, the stability boundary is exposed by
libc; the kernel interface to libc is private. Therefore, the version
of the kernel and libc in the alien zone must be similar to that in
the global zone. No check is made for compatibility, the user is
entirely responsible for making sure that the combination will work.
.LP
(In practice, the rate of change of kernel interfaces in illumos is
low. While creating an alien zone from a newer version of a
distribution than the version of Tribblix installed in the global zone
may be problematic, if the alien distribution is older than the version
of Tribblix in the global zone there is a good chance of success.)
.LP
The recommended way to create zones in Tribblix is to use the
zone-create subcommand of the \fBzap\fR(1) utility.
.LP
For an alien-root zone, specify -t alien as follows.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBzap create-zone -t alien ...\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp
.LP
The location of the tarball or ISO image to be used as the source for
the zone file system needs to be specified as follows.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBzap create-zone ... -I\fR \fI/path/to/distro.iso\fR \fB...\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp
