.TH "WHOLE-ROOT" "5" "Jun 4, 2017" "Tribblix"
.SH "NAME"
whole-root zone variant
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The whole-root zone brand in Tribblix is similar to, but not identical
to, the whole-root zones in Solaris 10.
.LP
By default, the newly created zone will have a complete copy of the
software installed in the global zone. Unlike Solaris 10, you can
easily create a zone with a subset of the global zone's software
package, and can easily add additional software.
.LP
The recommended way to create zones in Tribblix is to use the
zone-create subcommand of the \fBzap\fR(1) utility.
.LP
For a whole-root zone, specify -t whole as follows.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBzap create-zone -t whole ...\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp
.LP
To limit the new zone to only containing a subset of the global zone's
installed package overlays, use the -o flag, for example.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBzap create-zone ... -o\fR \fIdevelop\fR \fB...\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp
.LP
To add an additional package overlay to the new zone, use the -O flag,
for example.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBzap create-zone ... -O\fR \fIdevelop-extras\fR \fB...\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp
