I started with a copy of /usr/lib/brand/ipkg

Changed /usr/lib/brand/ipkg to /usr/lib/brand/sparse-root globally

foreach file ( * )
gsed -i s:/usr/lib/brand/ipkg:/usr/lib/brand/sparse-root:g $file
end


So we need to replace pkgcreatezone:

cat /var/sadm/install/contents | nawk '{print $1}' | nawk -F/ '{print $2}' | uniq -c

bin        - create symlink
boot 	   - kill
dev	   - ignore (zoneadm handles it)
devices	   - kill
etc	   - populate with fresh copy
export	   - create empty
home	   - skip
kernel	   - kill
lib	   - lofs mount
mnt	   - create empty
opt	   - skip (for tribblix zones anyway)
platform   - lofs mount
proc	   - ignore (zoneadm handles it)
sbin	   - lofs mount
system	   - ignore (zoneadm handles it)
tmp	   - create empty
usr	   - lofs mount
var	   - populate with fresh copy

for lofs mounts, need to mkdir the mountpoint

Need to handle /var/sadm specially; remove any paths from the contents
file starting with the killed directories.

For etc and var, either copy the global zone or the pspooled file. By
only copying what the packaging system says is there, we should avoid
copying junk. Then copy /var/sadm with a fixed up contents file.

Handling /lib is awkward; it contains SMF manifests which we don't want
in a zone, so I've forced a copy under /zonelib/lib which we can edit
(in the global zone).

The list of files to omit there is handled by an ignorelist. From an
illumos-gate package repo, in the pkg directory, look for files with
the variant.opensolaris.zone=global property. Something like

grep zone=global */* | grep -v ':dir ' | grep path=lib | tr ' ' '\n' | grep path= | sort | sed s:path=:/: > /tmp/lib.ignorelist

grep zone=global */* | grep -v ':dir ' | egrep -v path='(lib|usr|sbin|platform|boot|dev|kernel)' | tr ' ' '\n' | grep path= | sort | sed s:path=:/: > /tmp/sparse.ignorelist

grep zone=global */* | grep -v ':dir ' | egrep -v path='(etc|lib|platform|boot|dev|kernel)' | tr ' ' '\n' | grep path= | sort | sed s:path=:/: > /tmp/whole.ignorelist

although we only really need to filter out the SMF stuff.

You need to combine the lists for the different variants to be sure you
catch everything.

For whole-root zones and template zones, we can filter everything out,
including quite a few files under /usr.

While sparse-root is the brand, you need a template. So that's what
TRIBsparse.xml is - which goes into /etc/zones, and then you 'create
-t TRIBsparse' in zonecfg.

Alien zones:

An alien zone is one containing an alternative illumos distro.

The smarts here is in live-iso-unpack, which takes an iso image,
unpacks it, and munges it into whatever shape is required to
boot as a zone.

It has been extended to add images from tarballs (like zmvi) and zfs send
streams (such as the kayak datasets available for download from OmniOS).

This is a separate brand so an administrator can easily spot that
it's different, and tools can manage them appropriately.
